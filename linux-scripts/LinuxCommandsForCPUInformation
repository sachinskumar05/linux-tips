The CPU information includes details about the processor, like the architecture, vendor name, model, number of cores, a speed of each core etc. 
There are quite a few commands on Linux to get those details about the CPU hardware, and here is about some of the commands.

/proc/cpuinfo
lscpu        ## 
hardinfo     ## displays hardware information in a GTK+ window, you can install it as: apt-get install hardinfo
lshw         ## hwinfo is used to extract info about the hardware present in a Linux system. To display info about your CPU, use the --cpu
nproc        ## Print Number of Processing Units
dmidecode    ## For retrieving hardware information of any Linux system. It dumps a computerâ€™s DMI (a.k.a SMBIOS) table contents in a human-readable format for easy retrieval
cpuid        ## dumps complete information about the CPU(s) collected from the CPUID instruction, and also discover the exact model of x86 CPU(s) from that information
inxi         ## To display complete CPU information, including per CPU clock-speed and CPU max speed (if available), use the -C flag
