Details of Linux Networking Commands
1. ifconfig
  Linux ifconfig stands for interface configurator. It is one of the most basic commands used in network inspection. 
  ifconfig is used to initialize an interface, configure it with an IP address, and enable or disable it. It is also used to display the route and the network interface. 
  Basic information displayed upon using ifconfig are:
    IP address
    MAC address
    MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit) 

  To get details of specific interface
    Using this command, you can get details of a specific interface. This is shown below.

    Commands:
    ifconfig eth0
    ifconfig lo
    ifconfig wlan0
    To assign an IP address and Gateway to an interface
    This command can also be used to assign an IP address and Gateway to an interface. However, these details will be reset after the system reboot.
    Syntax: ifconfig eth0 <address> netmask <address>   
    
  To enable or disable an interface
    ifconfig can be used to enable or disable an interface. 
    Syntax: ifup eth0 
  To disable an interface
    Syntax: ifdown eth0 
  To set the size of MTU
    By default, MTU has a size of 1500. This can be however set externally by the user using ifconfig.
    Syntax: Ifconfig eth0 mtu xxxx
            XXXX can be replaced by the size of your choice.
